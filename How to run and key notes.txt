Minerals added must be commensurate to aqueous species


Usually the reasons for nonconvergence are:

1. Time step too large - set rcour to 0.5 (cfl condition).

2. Chemical system overdetermined. Look at mineral assemblages.

3. Ionic strength increasing to outside range during iteration. Try setting stimax to between 2-8.

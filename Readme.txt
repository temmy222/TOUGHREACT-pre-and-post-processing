This folder simulates flow through reactions in a cement consisting of 8 minerals - 2 in equilibrium and 6 undergoing kinetics

These folder contains simulations following the file 'Cement Batch Reaction 2'

Kinetic data is gotten from literature (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12665-017-6771-x#Sec3) 

while minerals C3HF6 and Tobermorite are assumed to be in equilibrium due to no kinetic data

Volume fraction of cement is assumed with similar composition to (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12665-017-6771-x#Sec3) 

Reactive suface areas also derived from (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12665-017-6771-x#Sec3) 

CO2 partial pressure was taken arbitrarily to be 1.1 bar (subject to sensitivity).
